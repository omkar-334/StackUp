**Step 1: Overview**

Vectorization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the process of representing words, phrases or documents as numerical vectors that can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms. It is the process of converting textual data into a form that can be understood and processed by computers.

The concept of vectorization is based on the idea that computers and machine learning algorithms can only process numerical data. Therefore, in order to perform any sort of analysis on text data, it is necessary to convert it into a numerical form. This is done by assigning a unique numerical value (i.e., a vector) to each word or phrase in the text.

Overall, vectorization is an essential tool in the world of machine learning and natural language processing, and it helps us make sense of the vast amounts of text data that we encounter every day. In this quest, we cover 3 different vectorization techniques: Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Word Embeddings.

**Step 2: Bag-of-Words (BoW)**

The most common technique for vectorization in NLP is the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. The BoW model represents a document as a bag of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of their frequency of occurrence. Each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies, where each element in the vector corresponds to the frequency of a specific word in the document

The BoW model involves the following steps:

1. **Tokenization:** text is first tokenized into individual words, also called tokens. This involves breaking the text into words or other meaningful units (e.g. phrases)
2. **Vocabulary creation: **creates a vocabulary of unique words that appear in the corpus of text
3. **Vectorization:** each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies. The vector is as long as the vocabulary size and the values are the frequency of each word in the document

Let’s take an example to make things more clear. Suppose we have the following two sentences:

* “StackUp is useful for learning”
* “StackUp is great for beginners”

To apply the BoW model, we first need to create a vocabulary of all the unique words in the two sentences. In this case, our vocabulary would be: [stackup, is, useful, for, learning, great, beginners].

Next, we count the frequency of each word in each sentence and create a vector for each sentence. For the first sentence, the vector would be: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means that the word “StackUp” appears once, “is” appears once, “useful” appears once, and so on.

The second sentence would have a vector: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1].

Once we have created these vectors, we can use them as input to machine learning models. The BoW model is a simple and effective way of representing text data for machine learning tasks such as text classification or clustering.

Lets try creating a bag of words by implementing a type of Vectorizer. Here, we will implement the [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) in the scikit-learn library, a machine learning library for Python. **Head on over to the Jupyter notebook for this quest, linked in the resources below, and follow the instructions in the Bag-of-Words Model (BOW) section.**

**Step 3: What is TF-IDF?**

Term frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a numerical statistic that is used to measure the importance of a term in a large dataset of documents. Rather than simply counting word frequencies, TF-IDF also considers the rarity of each word across the corpus. It assigns higher weights to words that are rare in the corpus and lower weights to words that are common. This is because common words may not be very useful for distinguishing between documents as they occur frequently in many documents regardless of the topic. This reflects and emphasises how important a term in a document is in the context of the entire corpus.

For example, if you were to consider a dataset of news articles about sports, the words “game”, “score” or “team” is likely to appear frequently in almost all the articles, regardless if the article is about basketball, football or any other sport. Thus, those three words would not be useful in distinguishing between articles. However, rarer words like “racket” or “breaststroke” may only appear in a few articles, and would be more useful for distinguishing between those articles.

TF-IDF is commonly used in information retrieval and text mining applications to identify important terms in a corpus of many documents, perform document classification, and for other tasks.

**Step 4: Creating a TF-IDF Model in Python**

Now that you understand the difference between the two methods, here’s how the TF-IDF technique works:

1. **Term Frequency (TF): **TF is a measure of how frequently a word appears in a document. It is calculated by dividing the number of times a word appears in a document by the total number of words in the document. This results in a score between 0 and 1, representing how important the word is to that document.
2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): **IDF is a measure of how common or rare a word is across all documents in the corpus. It is calculated by taking the logarithm of the total number of documents in the text divided by the number of documents that contain the word. This gives us a score higher for rare words across the text and lower for common words.
3. **TF-IDF score: **We multiply the TF score by the IDF score to get the TF-IDF score for each word. This gives us a score representing how important the word is to the document relative to the rest of the text. Terms that appear frequently in a document but are rare across the corpus will have a high TF-IDF score, while terms that are common across many documents will have a low score.

TF-IDF can be used to preprocess text data for machine learning algorithms, as it can help us identify important words and filter out noise or irrelevant words. It is commonly used in applications such as information retrieval, text classification, and document similarity.

Now, let’s see it in action!  **Head on back to the same Jupyter notebook as before** , where we experiment with the TF-IDF algorithm using the scikit-learn library.

**Step 5: Differences Between BoW and TF-IDF**

We have covered both BoW and the TF-IDF models above. However, the BoW model has its own limitations, such as not capturing the semantics of text and being sensitive to stop words or common words that do not carry much meaning. TF-IDF can be used to address such limitations.

TF-IDF is a technique that builds on the BoW model but takes into account the importance of words in the corpus. By multiplying the term frequency by the inverse document frequency, we get a weight that reflects both the importance of the term within the document and its rarity across the entire corpus. As such, TF-IDF can help to identify and emphasise the most relevant words in a document or corpus.

Comparing the two models, TF-IDF is a more sophisticated technique that takes into account the rarity of words across the corpus. TF-IDF can be more effective in identifying the most relevant words and filtering out noise or irrelevant words. However, both techniques are useful in their own ways in different contexts, and can also be used in combination to improve text representation and analysis.

**Step 6: What are Word Embeddings?**

In NLP, we often represent words as vectors. Vectorization is commonly done using the two techniques we've covered above, BoW and TF-IDF. However, these vectors can be very high-dimensional, which makes them computationally expensive to work with.

This is where word embeddings come into play. Word embeddings are a way to reduce the dimensionality of these vectors, while still capturing the meaning of the words. The idea behind word embeddings is that words that are similar in meaning will have vectors that are close together in this lower-dimensional space. For example, the vectors for “apple” and “pear” might be closer together, while the vector for “dinosaur” might be farther away.

To create a word embedding, we start with a large amount of text, such as a collection of books or a dataset of tweets. An algorithm is then used to map each word to a lower-dimensional vector.

Once we have created a set of word embeddings, we can use them to represent words in our NLP models. For example, if we were building a sentiment analysis model, we might use word embeddings to represent the words in our text input. We can then feed these embeddings into a neural network or other machine learning models to make predictions.

Word embeddings are important because they allow us to perform complex NLP tasks that would be difficult or impossible using traditional Bag-of-Words or other approaches. For example, we can use word embeddings to:

* Measure the semantic similarity between two words
* Perform text classification and sentiment analysis
* Generate text using language models

**Step 7: Creating Word Embeddings in Python**

Now that we understand what word embeddings are and why they are important, let's take a look at how we can create them using Python. There are several popular libraries for creating word embeddings in Python, including [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) and [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

For this quest, we will be using Gensim and a [Word2Vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html) model, which trains a neural network to predict the context of a word given its neighbouring words.  **Returning to the same Jupyter notebook** , we will cover the steps to create word embeddings using Gensim.

**Step 8: Differences Between TF-IDF and Word Embeddings**

We have covered both TF-IDF and word embeddings above. The main difference between TF-IDF and word embeddings is that TF-IDF is a count-based method, while word embeddings are a prediction-based method. The implication of this is that TF-IDF relies on counting the occurrences of words in a document and across the corpus and uses those counts to assign a weight to each word. While this approach is simple and effective, it does not capture the semantic meaning of the words.

Word embeddings, on the other hand, are created by predicting the context of a word given its neighbouring words. This approach captures the semantic meaning of words, but it is more complex and requires more computational resources.

The table below highlights some key differences between word embeddings and TF-IDF:
